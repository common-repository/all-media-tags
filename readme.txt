Adds a "Media Tag" taxonomy to media library items to help improve native WordPress search.

== Description ==

The All Media Tags plugin is a helpful tool which adds a tag based taxonomy to media items so that when you upload your images you can categorise or tag them with meaningful terms. You can then use these terms to search the Media Library and display all relevant images, pdfs, etc.

This should be one of the simplest plugins you've ever installed, **no set up required**.

* Upload the contents of this zip into your "plugins" folder
* Log into your backend and enable the plugin through the Plugins page
* Upload your media item
* Edit your media item and add "tags" to it as you would for posts
